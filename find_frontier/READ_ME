"""
find_frontier A* strategy taken from: https://github.com/bnurbekov/Turtlebot_Navigation

modifications to fit hsr (no more A* strategy, object detection incorporated into the dynamic movement) made by my-name-is-D .
Note: in the case of the hsr, could be ameliorated in term of optimisation/time by removing useless parts linked to the previous utilisation. 

"""

This package map autonomously the environnment. A bit slow.


There is now no A* strategy, no need with the /goal action of the hsr which also includes obstacle avoidance.
The map is recorded with hector map but it could also be done with gmapping (see launch file, the gmapping part is commented)


The map has to be saved manually:
rosrun map_server map_saver -f mymap
