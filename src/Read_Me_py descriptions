Move.py
Action movement to send a position to the hsr base

set_goal_v3.py 
First version of the get_closest_ accessible point service to an object
with autonomous map recuperation.
(previous versions in  rubbish)

Ameliorations to be done: the goal may be in an object as a table or chair.
So a "do something else " has to be added if goal innacessible.

smach_node.py
architecture of the actions.
Get action :done.
The rest....

test_launch.py
Test file to check to launch a roslaunch from a python file with a stop command coming from a topic. Success (to be put in rubbish when usefulness reaches 0)

test_map_exploration.py
TRASH, useless. But i'm keeping it there for now because... because i spent too much time on it so I'm hoping to maybe reuse it. TT

test_pub.py
Goes with test_launch.py. It's the stop topic publisher .
